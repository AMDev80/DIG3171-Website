  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>
    Every day, in one way or another – and as long as we have access to the internet - people engage in some form of Artificial Intelligence. Whether it is AI slop that filters into their social media feeds 
    (e.g., shortform content or, increasingly, advertisement material) or falling victim to a new form of cyberattack hoisted by an AI agent, people are spending more of their days engaged in the workings of 
    AI. Overtime, and as more consumers flooded the market, AI and personality became intertwined. With pushes from big tech corporations, like Meta's AI character-persona chatbots in 2023 (Clayton, “Meta 
    Announces AI Chatbots with 'Personality'”), research in AI personality and its development has become very popular. Machine Learning models have effectively trained themselves to replicate or imitate 
    personalities which can be attributed to the big data collected via social media and other internet sources (Naz et al. 6). Platforms such as Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and heavily trafficked websites 
    like Google and even popular email-messaging services have contributed to the big data used to train these personality models. In the years of its recent development, staggering statistics of chatbot personality 
    effectiveness have come into light. In sample study of about 1,052 individuals answering a General Social Survey conducted by researchers at Stanford University, an AI model was able to successfully simulate the 
    personalities of these people with 85% accuracy (Park et al.). In another study of around 1,500, an AI chatbot was able to infer the personalities of the university students –based on self-reported Big Five personality 
    measures – using no more than 30-minutes of interaction (Fan et al.). As it has progressed, designers and users alike have become skeptical of the effects of the uncanny valley of mind in personality infused chatbots 
    (Skjuve et al.; Kim et al.). However, as we careen toward the ultimate goal of Artificial General Intelligence, AI personality research and development is nowhere close to stopping (Fahad et al. 6). In that respect, 
    this project showcases the current status and effectiveness of AI simulated personality. The Logos, Pathos, and Oneiros chatbots (powered by Botpress) represent three major facets of personality: logic, emotion, and creativity, 
    respectively. Experimenting with their output, either by user input or with inter-chatbot conversations, is the goal of this research project.
