|                   *Voyant Word Visualization*                    |

## Experience with Voyant 
While analyzing Voyant's data visualization of a part of the [Complete Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Poetry](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ascp/index.htm), I can definitively see the etymological line from Old English the Modern English we use today, especially in our usage of function and grammatical words. Seeing the words like "Ã¾Ã¦t" or "Ã¾onne" in my results made me think they meant a lot more than just "that" or "then" in modern English. However, because Voyant did not filter these words out - as it would with Modern English texts - I was not correct in their meanings. Voyant is no dictionary, only an elaborate counting tool. Although it wasn't as effective as I originally believed, Voyant was able to reveal to me an aspect of Old English I didn't realize before. We may get frustrated with English grammar today, but back then it was far more complex. I believe the results are accurate, as when I select the words Voyant is able to show each occurrence and in what document they belong to.

## Experience with Copilot 
Copilot can only give me very generic answers. It failed when providing it links to the corpus texts I used (the same links I provided Voyant as input). Instead, I gave it two stories to work on, however was inhibited by a character count of 8,000 (the texts were ["The Fates of the Apostles"](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ascp/a02_02.htm) and ["The Seafarer"](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ascp/a03_09.htm)- part of it, actually). However, as evident from one of Copilot's responses listed, this was not enough to form a significant analysis. In effort to get some substance, I prompted for a generic response of the most common words that appears in Old English texts (see 20 Most Frequent Words). Although it can be somewhat confirmed that Copilot was able to accurately give me useful analysis, I trust it far less than Voyant.

## Conclusion
After using both Voyant and Copilot, and analyzing the "results" they have provided me, I have reached the consensus that they are both useful tools for distant reading - Voyant being my preferred tool. By providing a quantitative look at texts in a corpus, such as the  [Complete Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Poetry](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ascp/index.htm) I used in this exercise, these tools can magnify the diction and reveal deeper themes that would not have been noticed otherwise. However, a limitation I faced when using these tools was how the data will not draw the conclusions for us. While I did not know this until I researched the words and parsed through the text itself, the most common words that appeared in the Old English texts were functional-grammatical words (as would be expected from a modern English corpus). If, instead, I were to use an modern English text, the "filler" words such as "in," "the," and "it" would be filtered out. Afterwards, and as I experimented with Copilot, I asked it to provide me the definition of the most common words. Fortunately, this was something Copilots exceled at, being that it is a multifaceted tool. The takeaway I have from this exercise and in using both these tools is that Copilot may be able to give me useful information but it would not be the best, most-trustworthy, and if I were looking to develop and draw my own conclusions with definitive textual calculations, I would use Voyant as my tool of choice.

These results reflect the **initial lines** of the corpus, so the frequency counts are still low. If you'd like, I can expand the analysis to include the **entire text** you pasted and provide a more representative frequency list.

Would you like me to do that next?
