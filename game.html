<h1>My Digital Narrative</h1>
  <p>
    "<a href="/DIG3171-Website/Brainrot or not.html" target="_blank">Brainrot or not...</a>" is a short digital narrative game created in Bitsy. 
    The game follows the day of a college student, the player (you) will make decisions based on a "Brainrot" behavior, "Optimized" behavior, or choose to do nothing at all (a normal behavior).
  </p>
  <p>
    There are five endings: Normal, Optimized, Burn Out, Brainrot, and Complete Brainrot. Play through "Brainrot or not..." to get them all!

<h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>
    Being one of the most popular words of last year - chosen as 2024 Word of the Year by Oxford University Press - "brainrot" has become a global phenomenon. Defined with words such as "overconsumption" and "deterioration," 
    one must consider the cause of this idea to be so commonplace in the ongoings of younger generations and technology. On one hand, brainrot is seen as the conscious, decompression-driven genre with willing rejection of 
    self-development and productivity that younger generations partake in. On the other, it is the affliction suffered as a result of this overconsumption. To explain, the consumption and interaction with media such as YouTube, 
    Instagram, and TikTok who promote short form content lead to some serious adverse affects - distorted memory, attention span, problem solving, and other cultural and social influences. These affects are exacerbated by 
    "brainrotting"-behaviors like doomscrolling, zombiescrolling, and capitulating to social media loops. However, this produces the idea that productivity or optimizing one's actions is the antithesis to this behavior 
    with productivity being a focus of our culture's consumer habits. In the same vein, over-optimization and toxic productivity can lead to burnout which, compared to brainrot, can be similarly detrimental. "Brainrot or not..." 
    explores how a student may engage in these different behaviors, and whether there is such thing as finding a balance between them.
