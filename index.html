<h1>Welcome to the Sample Github Portfolio</h1>
<p>
<i>Note: I have this set up for someone who is new to Github and is using it in their browser. If you are familiar with Github, feel free to use your own site organization, theme, css, etc.</i>

Click through the sample website, and see how to organize your assignments for this course.

<h2>Why Github? </h2>  
    <p>This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code–and even to write them in the same software as code–for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use Markdown, which is another impressive skill for your resume.
    </p><br>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<li> Fork (copy) this whole repository, then you can just edit the content with your own work, creating your own portfolio!
<li> index.html = your home page
<li> You can edit the HTML files directly on GitHub.
<li> Commit changes… means save. Don’t forget to save!
<li> Preview is a great way to check before saving.
<li> After you click “commit changes…” it will ask you to describe your changes. It will auto-fill this, so feel free to just click “commit changes” and not worry about notes about what you did.
<li> Make any changes you’d like to show off your coding skills!
