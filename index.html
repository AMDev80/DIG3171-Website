<h2>Who am I?</h2>  
    <p>Hello! My name is Aidan and I am a CS Major in my last year with a particular interest in Graphics Programming. I'm from central Florida, spending most of my childhood on the Space Coast.</p>
    <p>So far, I've been doing what I can to further my studies and professional career. I'm currently working as a software engineer intern DiSTI, a company right off of the UCF campus. I was very blessed with that opportunity and have learned a lot since working there </p>
    <p>Although it's hard work - full-time student, full-time worker, and soon-to-be dad - I'm grateful for every moment. I love what I do. I love learning. And I know I'll enjoy learning in this class!
    <p>Outside of the professional, here are some quick facts about me:</p>
    <li>I am learning the banjo</li>
    <li>I love to play and watch soccer</li>
    <li>I am a proud dad of 2 cats, a bearded dragon, and a 3-legged dog named Danny (aka Lieutenant Dan!)</li>
