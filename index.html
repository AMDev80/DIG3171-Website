Welcome to the Sample Portfolio Repository
Note
I have this set up for someone who is new to Github and is using it in their browser. If you are familiar with Github, feel free to use your own site organization, theme, css, etc.

Click through the sample website, and see how to organize your assignments for this course.

Why Github?
This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code–and even to write them in the same software as code–for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use Markdown, which is another impressive skill for your resume.

Basics
Fork (copy) this whole repository, then you can just edit the content with your own work, creating your own portfolio!
index.md = your home page
You can edit the markdown files directly on GitHub.
Commit changes… means save. Don’t forget to save!
Preview is a great way to check before saving.
After you click “commit changes…” it will ask you to describe your changes. It will auto-fill this, so feel free to just hit “commit changes” and not worry about notes about what you did.
Make any changes you’d like to show off your skills with Markdown and coding!

How to Fork (copy) this Repository
Create or log into your own Github account first!!
<li>
Go to the Repository
Fork the Repository
In the top right corner of the repository page, click the “Fork” button. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
Navigate to Your Fork
Once the repository is forked, you’ll be redirected to your copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
Create or Edit Files
To create a new file, click the “Add file” button and select “Create new file”.
To edit an existing file, navigate to the file and click the pencil icon (✏️) in the top right corner of the file view.
Make Your Changes
Use the GitHub editor to make your changes. You can write and edit Markdown files directly in the browser.
Save Your Changes
After making your changes, scroll down to the “Commit changes” section.
It will ask you for a commit message describing your changes, but you can just accept the auto-generated description (this is not a big deal).
Make sure “Commit directly to the main branch” is chosen (it should be by default) and click “Commit changes.”
